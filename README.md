# Linux-Payload
Note: This payload is still in development and is not yet operational.

This is an example of a payload that can be used in conjunction with Nekrosis to establish persistence on a Linux target. By virtue of being a deployable payload it is written in pure C and thus assumes no dependencies on the target system.
